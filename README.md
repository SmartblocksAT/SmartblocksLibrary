# Goal
The Goal is to develop a microcontroller environment for students, which should make it easy for them to start programming with microcontrollers.

We started this Project in February of 2019.
In this time a rough concept that defined the function and dimensions was created and presented to teachers who would later use this project. A proof of concept has been worked on in the summer in order to get an idea of ​​how the project could develop and look like.

As soon as the project was successfully submitted, the existing elements of the prototype, such as the web interface, sample programs and the practical structure, were revised and improved.

# Components
This Project consists of two Components:

 - The webinterface (can be found [here](https://github.com/SmartblocksAT/SmartblocksWeb))
 - ESP32 Library (this repository)

## Who is responsible for this?
Lukas Kamleitner <lukas.kamleitner@smartblocks.dev>
